Nakama Cocos2d-x C++ Client SDK
=============

> Cocos2d-x C++ client for Nakama server.

[Nakama](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama) is an open-source server designed to power modern games and apps. Features include user accounts, chat, social, matchmaker, realtime multiplayer, and much [more](https://heroiclabs.com).

This client implements the full API and socket options with the server. It's written in C++ with minimal dependencies to support Cocos2d-x, Unreal and other custom engines and frameworks.

If you experience any issues with the client, it can be useful to enable debug logs (see [Logging](#logging) section) and [open an issue](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cpp/issues).

Full documentation is online - https://heroiclabs.com/docs

## Getting Started

You'll need to setup the server and database before you can connect with the client. The simplest way is to use Docker but have a look at the [server documentation](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama#getting-started) for other options.

1. Install and run the servers. Follow these [instructions](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart).

2. Download the SDK from the [releases page](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cocos2d-x/releases).

3. Integrate the SDK into your project:

### Setup for CMake projects

Add following to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
find_package(nakama-cpp-cocos2d-x)
target_link_libraries(${APP_NAME} nakama-cpp-cocos2d-x)
```

## Threading model

Nakama C++ is designed to use in one thread only.

## Usage

The client object has many methods to execute various features in the server or open realtime socket connections with the server.

Include nakama helper header.

```cpp
#include "NakamaCocos2d/NCocosHelper.h"
```

Initialize logger with debug logging level.

```cpp
using namespace Nakama;

NCocosHelper::init(NLogLevel::Debug);
```

Use the connection credentials to build a client object.

```cpp
NClientParameters parameters;
parameters.serverKey = "defaultkey";
parameters.host = "127.0.0.1";
parameters.port = DEFAULT_PORT;
NClientPtr client = NCocosHelper::createDefaultClient(parameters);
```

The `createDefaultClient` will create HTTP/1.1 client to use REST API.

## Tick

The `tick` method pumps requests queue and executes callbacks in your thread. You must call it periodically (recommended every 50ms) in your thread.

```cpp
auto tickCallback = [this](float dt)
{
    client->tick();
    if (rtClient)
        rtClient->tick();
};

auto scheduler = Director::getInstance()->getScheduler();
scheduler->schedule(tickCallback, this, 0.05f /*sec*/, CC_REPEAT_FOREVER, 0, false, "nakama-tick");
```

Without this the default client and realtime client will not work, and you will not receive responses from the server.

### Authenticate

There's a variety of ways to [authenticate](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/authentication) with the server. Authentication can create a user if they don't already exist with those credentials. It's also easy to authenticate with a social profile from Google Play Games, Facebook, Game Center, etc.

```cpp
string email = "super@heroes.com";
string password = "batsignal";

auto successCallback = [](NSessionPtr session)
{
    CCLOG("session token: %s", session->getAuthToken().c_str());
};

auto errorCallback = [](const NError& error)
{
};

client->authenticateEmail(email, password, "", false, {}, successCallback, errorCallback);
```

### Sessions

When authenticated the server responds with an auth token (JWT) which contains useful properties and gets deserialized into a `NSession` object.

```cpp
CCLOG("%s", session->getAuthToken().c_str()); // raw JWT token
CCLOG("%s", session->getUserId().c_str());
CCLOG("%s", session->getUsername().c_str());
CCLOG("Session has expired: %s", session->isExpired() ? "yes" : "no");
CCLOG("Session expires at: %llu", session->getExpireTime());
CCLOG("Session created at: %llu", session->getCreateTime());
```

It is recommended to store the auth token from the session and check at startup if it has expired. If the token has expired you must reauthenticate. The expiry time of the token can be changed as a setting in the server.

```cpp
string authtoken = "restored from somewhere";
NSessionPtr session = restoreSession(authtoken);
if (session->isExpired()) {
    CCLOG("Session has expired. Must reauthenticate!");
}
```

### Requests

The client includes lots of builtin APIs for various features of the game server. These can be accessed with the async methods. It can also call custom logic as RPC functions on the server. These can also be executed with a socket object.

All requests are sent with a session object which authorizes the client.

```cpp
auto successCallback = [](const NAccount& account)
{
    CCLOG("user id : %s", account.user.id.c_str());
    CCLOG("username: %s", account.user.username.c_str());
    CCLOG("wallet  : %s", account.wallet.c_str());
};

client->getAccount(session, successCallback, errorCallback);
```

### Realtime client

The client can create one or more realtime clients with the server. Each realtime client can have it's own events listener registered for responses received from the server.

```cpp
bool createStatus = true; // if the socket should show the user as online to others.
// define realtime client in your class as NRtClientPtr rtClient;
rtClient = NCocosHelper::createRtClient(client, DEFAULT_PORT);
// define listener in your class as NRtDefaultClientListener listener;
listener.setConnectCallback([]()
{
    CCLOG("Socket connected");
});
rtClient->setListener(&listener);
rtClient->connect(session, createStatus);
```

Don't forget to call `tick` method. See [Tick](#tick) section for details.

### Logging

Client logging is off by default.

To enable logs output to console with debug logging level:

```cpp
NCocosHelper::init(NLogLevel::Debug);
```

## Contribute

The development roadmap is managed as GitHub issues and pull requests are welcome. If you're interested to enhance the code please open an issue to discuss the changes or drop in and discuss it in the [community forum](https://forum.heroiclabs.com).

## Source Builds

The cocos2d-x C++ SDK is based on [General C++ SDK](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cpp)

The prerequisites for building the SDK are vcpkg (installed at $VCPKG_ROOT), python 2.7 and CMake.

We build Cocos from source and link our library against it to verify correctness. It requires
the following:

### OSX

brew install freetype
