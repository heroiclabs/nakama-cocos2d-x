Nakama Cocos2d-x C++ Client SDK
=============

> Cocos2d-x C++ client for Nakama server.

[Nakama](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama) is an open-source server designed to power modern games and apps. Features include user accounts, chat, social, matchmaker, realtime multiplayer, and much [more](https://heroiclabs.com).

This client implements the full API and socket options with the server. It's written in C++ with minimal dependencies to support Cocos2d-x, Unreal and other custom engines and frameworks.

If you experience any issues with the client, it can be useful to enable debug logs (see [Logging](#logging) section) and [open an issue](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cpp/issues).

Full documentation is online - https://heroiclabs.com/docs

## Getting Started

You'll need to setup the server and database before you can connect with the client. The simplest way is to use Docker but have a look at the [server documentation](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama#getting-started) for other options.

1. Install and run the servers. Follow these [instructions](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart).

2. Download the SDK from the [releases page](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cocos2d-x/releases).

3. Integrate the SDK into your project:

### Setup for CMake projects

Add following to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
set(nakama-sdk_DIR <path-to-nakama-sdk>/share/nakama-sdk)
find_package(nakama-sdk)
target_link_libraries(${APP_NAME} nakama-sdk)
```

You will need to include `optional-lite` as well if you do not bring it in yourself.

```cmake
set(optional-lite_DIR <path-to-nakama-sdk>/share/optional-lite)
find_package(optional-lite)
target_link_libraries(${APP_NAME} nonstd::optional-lite)
```

Some users also like to include protobuf for their own serialization in their app. To include this, do the following:

```cmake
set(Protobuf_DIR <path-to-nakama-sdk>/share/protobuf)
find_package(Protobuf CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(${APP_NAME} protobuf::libprotobuf)
```

## Threading model

Nakama C++ is designed to use in one thread only.

## Usage

The client object has many methods to execute various features in the server or open realtime socket connections with the server.

Use the connection credentials to build a client object.

```cpp
NClientParameters parameters;
parameters.serverKey = "defaultkey";
parameters.host = "127.0.0.1";
parameters.port = DEFAULT_PORT;
NClientPtr client = createDefaultClient(parameters);
```

The `createDefaultClient` will create HTTP/1.1 client to use REST API.

### Android

The prebuilt library is built against Android NDK 23.2.8568313.

On Android, networking libraries for native activities implemented by Cocos require access to the Java virtual machine in order to run properly. Cocos exposes a helper for access to the JavaVM it uses. This must be passed to the platform parameters in the SDK:

```cpp
#include <JniHelper.h>

NClientParameters parameters;
// ... initialization of parameters
parameters.platformParams.javaVM = JniHelper::getJavaVM();
NClientPtr client = createDefaultClient(parameters);
```

Also see: https://cocos2d-x.org/reference/native-cpp/V3.3/df/df6/classcocos2d_1_1_jni_helper.html#a34abff3be15bc790ad2a09f9b7383488

## Tick

The `tick` method pumps requests queue and executes callbacks in your thread. You must call it periodically (recommended every 50ms) in your thread.

```cpp
auto tickCallback = [this](float dt)
{
    client->tick();
    if (rtClient)
        rtClient->tick();
};

auto scheduler = Director::getInstance()->getScheduler();
scheduler->schedule(tickCallback, this, 0.05f /*sec*/, CC_REPEAT_FOREVER, 0, false, "nakama-tick");
```

Without this the default client and realtime client will not work, and you will not receive responses from the server.

### Authenticate

There's a variety of ways to [authenticate](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/authentication) with the server. Authentication can create a user if they don't already exist with those credentials. It's also easy to authenticate with a social profile from Google Play Games, Facebook, Game Center, etc.

```cpp
string email = "super@heroes.com";
string password = "batsignal";

auto successCallback = [](NSessionPtr session)
{
    CCLOG("session token: %s", session->getAuthToken().c_str());
};

auto errorCallback = [](const NError& error)
{
};

client->authenticateEmail(email, password, "", false, {}, successCallback, errorCallback);
```

### Sessions

When authenticated the server responds with an auth token (JWT) which contains useful properties and gets deserialized into a `NSession` object.

```cpp
CCLOG("%s", session->getAuthToken().c_str()); // raw JWT token
CCLOG("%s", session->getUserId().c_str());
CCLOG("%s", session->getUsername().c_str());
CCLOG("Session has expired: %s", session->isExpired() ? "yes" : "no");
CCLOG("Session expires at: %llu", session->getExpireTime());
CCLOG("Session created at: %llu", session->getCreateTime());
```

It is recommended to store the auth token from the session and check at startup if it has expired. If the token has expired you must reauthenticate. The expiry time of the token can be changed as a setting in the server.

```cpp
string authtoken = "restored from somewhere";
NSessionPtr session = restoreSession(authtoken);
if (session->isExpired()) {
    CCLOG("Session has expired. Must reauthenticate!");
}
```

### Requests

The client includes lots of builtin APIs for various features of the game server. These can be accessed with the async methods. It can also call custom logic as RPC functions on the server. These can also be executed with a socket object.

All requests are sent with a session object which authorizes the client.

```cpp
auto successCallback = [](const NAccount& account)
{
    CCLOG("user id : %s", account.user.id.c_str());
    CCLOG("username: %s", account.user.username.c_str());
    CCLOG("wallet  : %s", account.wallet.c_str());
};

client->getAccount(session, successCallback, errorCallback);
```

### Realtime client

The client can create one or more realtime clients with the server. Each realtime client can have it's own events listener registered for responses received from the server.

```cpp
bool createStatus = true; // if the socket should show the user as online to others.
// define realtime client in your class as NRtClientPtr rtClient;
rtClient = client->createRtClient(DEFAULT_PORT);
// define listener in your class as NRtDefaultClientListener listener;
listener.setConnectCallback([]()
{
    CCLOG("Socket connected");
});
rtClient->setListener(&listener);
rtClient->connect(session, createStatus);
```

Don't forget to call `tick` method. See [Tick](#tick) section for details.

## Contribute

The development roadmap is managed as GitHub issues and pull requests are welcome. If you're interested to enhance the code please open an issue to discuss the changes or drop in and discuss it in the [community forum](https://forum.heroiclabs.com).

## Source Builds

The cocos2d-x C++ SDK is based on [General C++ SDK](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cpp)

The prerequisites for building the SDK are vcpkg (installed at $VCPKG_ROOT), CMake and git.

### Nakama Cocos2d-x Client guide

You can find Nakama Cocos2d-x Client guide [here](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/cocos2d-x-client-guide/).

## Full Cocos2d-x C++ Client example

You can find the Cocos2d-x C++ Client example [here](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cocos2d-x/tree/master/example)

Make sure cocos2d-x is installed and that you've manually set `COCOS_2DX_ROOT` to the repository.

To run the example, build our SDK and then use the cocos CLI in the example folder as documented in their README.
The example project will find the SDK in the `out` directory using the triplet you specify in the example `CMakeLists.txt`.
See `NAKAMA_TRIPLET` in that file.

For Android you will also need to pass the appropriate app-abi, for example:

`cocos compile -pandroid --app-abi arm64-v8a -m debug`
