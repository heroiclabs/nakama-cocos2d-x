Nakama Cocos2d-x
=============

> Cocos2d-x 3.17 client for Nakama server 1.4.

Nakama is an open-source distributed server for social and realtime games. For more information have a look at the [server documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/).

If you encounter any issues with the server you can generate diagnostics for us with `nakama doctor`. Send these to support@heroiclabs.com or [open an issue](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/issues). If you experience any issues with the client, it can be useful to enable trace (`NLogger::getInstance().SetLevel(NLogLevel::Trace);`) to produce logs and [open an issue](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cocos2d-x/issues).

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

To get started using Nakama in Cocos2d-x, you will need the following:

1. [Cocos2d-x Engine](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download) 3.17 or greater.
2. A compiler for the platform you are developing on, such as [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) on Windows or [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) on OSX.
3. [nakama-cocos2d-x](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cocos2d-x/releases)

#### Supported platforms

Windows, Android, iOS, Mac

#### Setup

To use nakama-cocos2d-x in your cocos2d-x project, you'll need to copy the nakama-cocos2d-x files you downloaded into the appropriate place. To do this:

1. Open your cocos2d-x project folder in Explorer or Finder.
2. Copy `cocos2d-x` engine folder to `cocos2d` folder
3. Copy the `Nakama` and `ThirdParty` folders from the nakama-cocos2d-x release you downloaded, into `Classes` folder.

Folder structure should be as following:
```
<Your Project Root>
   cocos2d
   Classes
       Nakama
       ThirdParty
```

4. Now add all .cpp, .cc files from Nakama folder to your project:
    * Windows - proj.win32\\{Project Name}.sln
    * Android - proj.android\app\jni\Android.mk
    * iOS/Mac - proj.ios_mac\\{Project Name}.xcodeproj

5. Add link libraries to your project:
    * libprotobuf - from Classes\ThirdParty\lib\\{platform}
    * websockets  - cocos2d\external\websockets\prebuilt\\{platform}

6. Add defines for project:
    * NAKAMA_API=
    * COCOS2D

7. Add include directories for project:
    * Classes\Nakama\Public\NakamaSDK
    * Classes\Nakama\Public
    * Classes\Nakama\Private
    * Classes\ThirdParty\include

At this point, you are done. Try to build.
